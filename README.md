# Chegg-Device-Bypass

This is a Chromium extension that removes the ridiculous device registration limitation on Chegg pages when a user is logged into their Chegg account on a third different device. ![](https://i.imgur.com/sw7sLZu.png) 

No where on their pricing pages do they announce this 2 device limit, so as a user with a phone, two laptops and a desktop, I've taken it upon myself to bypass limitations that were never presented to users with a few very simple lines of JS.
